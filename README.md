# Final_Project_CMSC320
This is the final project for CMSC320 by Rishabh Chheda, Vismay Igur and Chirag Jain. We got this data from Kaggle about House sale prices and various features that are used to determine a price of house. The aim of this project is to utilize the data to get the weightage of each parameter and ultimately predict the sales price of a house based on previous data.
